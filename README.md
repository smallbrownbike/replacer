This project was started to help companies give their customers a better of idea of how their products will look in a custom environment.

## SAMPLE - https://hellish-argument.surge.sh/

In this sample, the company is selling roof shingles. The customer has the option to upload a picture of their own house and see how the roof shingles would look if they were installed. The company also has the option to add three sample images (via a CMS) to allow their potential customers to use as an alternative to uploading their own.
